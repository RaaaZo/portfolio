        <Paragraph>
          In August 2020, I graduated from the second-cycle studies in
          Information Systems in Security, specialization:
          <Span> Information Systems in Security</Span>. At the end of my first
          year of studies, I started my adventure with programming at the
          university. However, I started to expand my competences in February
          this year. I focus on the development and deepening of knowledge.
          Programming has become my passion. I am a communicative language and
          open to new challenges. I love learning new things. I perform the
          entrusted task with care and accuracy.
